My time in Dublin and UK recently reminded me about some of what I think we can learn from Europe.

#### 1. Give young adults the opportunity to mature younger
I am always shocked by how much more mature Europeans between the ages of 16 and 21 are far more mature than their American counterparts. I have generally come to the conclusion that the freedom and trust that European culture gives them at a far younger age than American children have led to this. 

One obvious difference is the drinking age but I think that is more of explicit restriction that is just the tip of the iceberg for American teenagers. In the UK its common for children as young as 10 to take public transport on their own to school every day.

This is important because it makes European children more mature and employable than our American children. They are more entitled and less responsible and it's not their fault. They have to learn those skills half a decade later than their European counterparts do. 

#### 2. Lower the cost of higher education (and not through more subsidies)
Much of universities are subsidized in Europe but there are a few ways they have made higher education cheaper than we have. For one thing its only 3 years for most degrees. That is 25% reduction in the cost of higher education. That seems like something we could easily adopt. As a college graduate, I believe I could have easily reduced my course load down to 3 years without really losing any classes I felt were valuable.

Another way they have done this is that specialized schools like medicine and lawyers start in year 1 (or freshman year). For example, a doctor in the UK will go to school for five or six years starting at age 18. This looks like two years of pre-clinical training in an academic environment and three years clinical training. They can start practicing by age 24. That's only a year later than I when started than a typical US graduate. At least three to four years younger than most doctors in the US. This would make the cost of going into medicine far less onerous for doctors. The likely result would be reduced expenses for us.

#### 3. Increase housing density.
Living in the UK while I was in high school really changed my perception of the space people need to live. Fast-growing cities like Austin (where I live) need to find ways to either allow or encourage developers or landowners to increase density. There is a real aversion in the US to live in close proximity to your neighbor. Everyone wants more "space" while they live in a city. If you want more space you should go live in the country or small town, don't try to make your neighborhood in the city feel like something its not.
