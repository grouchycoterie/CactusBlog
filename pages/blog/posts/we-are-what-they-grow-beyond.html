I watched _Star Wars: The Last Jedi_. This article may contain spoilers. It's a fantastic movie I recommend, and I was not disappointed. A quote stuck out. Without further ado, queue spoilers:

>“Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.” — Master Yoda

This quote struck me because of its two main points: that failure is the greatest teacher and that as _masters_ our greatest burden is watching as our _apprentices_ grow beyond us.

#### The Greatest Teacher, Failure Is
I often need a reminding because our culture values success, easy success. We love movies and shows featuring prodigies and brilliant minds where success, wealth, and fame come easily for them.

It's similar to the lottery. We  dream of quick, easy money. We don't enjoy the difficulties of mastery. _Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also._ Real life, real success, comes at a great cost, failure. 

Failure is the greatest teacher. I know that from experience. I liken the strength of learning from failure to being burned. Anyone who has touched a hot stove or oven can tell you that any time they come close touching something hot they recoil instinctively. A young child is told, "don't touch" and we can explain that touching will hurt. However, only the pain, tears and enlightenment of experience can teach the instinctive recoil most of us have.

It's only when you have burned through risky investments you start investing more wisely. Burned by unhealthy relationships that you learn how to avoid them. We can't learn everything the _hard way_ but sometimes it's the most powerful and impactful lessons in our lives and the way we need to learn.

We should embrace failure, learn how to recoil from what we learn, and move on to fail again.

#### The True Burden of All Masters
Replace master with manager, parent, teacher, coach, trainer, or mentor and this message becomes more applicable to us all. Great teachers and mentors are humble. They are able to push their apprentices or children to heights they may never have been able to reach themselves. Their Egos don't limit them from being superseded or overshadowed by those they helped achieve great heights.

Since I am not a manager, or true mentor to anyone its a reminder that until now I have had many great teachers, mentors, parents, coaches. Each have helped me to achieve many successes. Bettering my skills, intuition and abilities, and that not only has improved me as a person as well as, enlarged my Ego.

I don't think thats unusual. This self-focus is necessary to learn, grow, and succeed as an individual. As I pour my effort and passion into this post it feeds my pride. There is no way around it, but at some point, my highest impact won't be my individual contributions. It will be what I can teach, how I can enable, lead and empower the next generation.

At that point, I need to be humble. We all need to learn how to enable the next generation of _masters_ to rise to greater heights than we have. It's been said that we stand on the shoulders of giants. At some point, we become those giants that others stand upon. We need to be humble and allow the apprentice to surpass the master.
